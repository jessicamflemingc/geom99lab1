  <h1> Hawaiian Islands </h>
  <p>The Hawaiian Islands were formed by volcanic activity and this map explores the locations of the volcanoes that are responsilbe for the creation of the islands. 
    Hawaii is an example of island chanins created by hot-spot volcanism. Each island is successively older toward the northwest. The purple markers indiciate
    active volcanoes, the green are inactive (or dormant) volcanoes and the yellow signifies the extninct volcanoes </p> 
  <p>The active volcanoes consist of Mauna Kea, Hual훮lai, Mauna Loa, K카lauea, Haleakal훮 and the kama'ehuakanaloa Seamount (formerly known as the Lo'ihi Seamount).
     Mauna Loa is known as the largest volcano on Earth and has erupted 33 times since 1843, with the last eruption in 1984 lasting more than 20 days and 
     lava flowed over 7km away. The K카lauea, which can be seen in the Southern part of the Big Island, and had erupted continously for over 4 decades. See more
     about these active volcanoes at <a href = "https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/active-volcanoes-hawaii"> </a></p>
